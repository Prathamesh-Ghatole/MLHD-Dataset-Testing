Ignore this repo if you don't already know what the above statement means 🤷‍♀️


Note that this repo just consists of rough work, and the code is not production ready.

Simple guide:
MLHD.ipynb -> Old code for analyzing the data (you can safely skip this one)
MLHD V2.ipynb -> Detailed observations and statistics for a random selection of data.
MLHD V3.ipynb -> Testing optimizations for code (loading up complete SQL tables, mass queries, etc..)
                    Please note that this repo is under construction.
